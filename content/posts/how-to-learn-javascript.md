I write a good bit of JavaScript for work and play. It's the bread-and-butter of a web developer. Here are my recommendations for how to learn JavaScript in 2024.

## Learn plain JavaScript

First, you gotta know the fundamentals. Don't dive into any frameworks, flavors, or libraries. Learning plain JavaScript is key to understanding how the language works and what other libraries are doing over top of it.

JavaScript will be around for many years while libraries and frameworks dip in and out of fashion. Deepen and invest in your understanding of  "vanilla" JS for the long-term.

## Where to begin

Get a **solid** understanding of the foundations. Then, all future learning will be much faster.

Start with a good book for a thorough introduction. "[Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)" is a great start-to-finish JavaScript resource. It is free, well structured, and fun. You'll know more than most after completing it.

Get some **practice** on [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8/). Do it at the same time as the book. Learning sticks when paired with some hands-on work.

## Keep what you've learned

Write down every new thing you lean. Create flashcards to remind yourself of what you've just learned. It's a lot to take inâ€”do the due diligence of hanging on to it.

## What is next

If you have an app in mind, build it with plain JavaScript. Then rebuild it with React to see how it compares.

Not every company or project will use [React](https://react.dev/), but it is likely to come across on your JavaScript journey. Knowing the true JS fundamentals is the most valuable asset. You can quickly learn other frameworks and libraries as needed.
