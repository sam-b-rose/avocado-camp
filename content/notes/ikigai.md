Ikigai is a Japanese concept that roughly translates to *reason for being*. It's about feeling your life makes a difference in people's lives.

The concept has the common misconception that it is all about finding your purpose. The popular Western interpretation  is that is the intersection of what you are good at, what the world needs, and what you can get paid for.

However, ikigai is much simpler. It is about finding pleasure in life and being happy to get up in the morning.

Ikigai is very personal, a reflection of the inner self. It creates a mental state of ease.

Iikigai is not a lofty goal, a destination something to achieve.

Do no rely on grand motivational frameworks. Find ikigai in the **small daily rituals** of life. It can be found in moments of silence or in creative flow.

1. Stop seeking you "one true passion"
2. Embrace lifelong learning
3. Let go of lofty financial goals
4. Focus your impact on your friends, family, and community

> Instead of pursuing a grand life purpose, optimize for wanting to wake up in the morning. Live a life of curiosity and connection. Trust that success will be a byproduct of the meaning you find in daily experiences.
