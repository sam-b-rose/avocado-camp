The main piece of advice: "keep the curtain up". The curtain is an analogy to protect your entrepreneurial spirit from your [[notes/comfort-zone|comfort zone]].

The E-Myth argues that are three parts to our personality that must be in balance for starting a business:

- **Entrepreneur:** the creative visionary who creates opportunities and focused on closing the gap between the business today and where they want to be in the the future
- **Manager:** the supervisor who delights in achieving results through people and systems and focuses on the present and strategizing for the future
- **Technician:** the crafter who lives in the present doing their work, delivering, and getting things done

## Highlights

> The people who are exceptionally good in business aren’t so because of what they know but because of their insatiable need to know more.

Stay excited about something. Learning is an [[notes/infinite-games|infinite game]] that keeps us moving. 

> That Fatal Assumption is: if you understand the technical work of a business, you understand a business that does that technical work. And the reason it’s fatal is that it just isn’t true.

A common assumption is to think that because you are good at something (craft, skill, service, etc) that you'd be good at creating a business around that thing.

> Every Adolescent business reaches a point where it pushes beyond its owner’s Comfort Zone—the boundary within which he feels secure in his ability to control his environment, and outside of which he begins to lose that control.

Learning how to delegate, not abdicate, is key to pushing beyond the comfort zone of controlling and doing all the work yourself. Letting go and teaching others the why and how of your business is essential to alleviating you from all the duties.

> Because true trust comes from knowing, not from blind faith. And to know, one must understand. And to understand, one must have an intimate awareness of what conditions are truly present.

Don't develop blind faith. Know and understand what conditions are present.

> But all the while, even while you’re guessing, the key is to plan, envision, and articulate what you see in the future both for yourself and for your employees. Because if you don’t articulate it—I mean, write it down, clearly, so others can understand it—you don’t own it!

Writing it down forces you to be clear (W)

> A Mature company is started differently than all the rest. A Mature company is founded on a broader perspective, an entrepreneurial perspective, a more intelligent point of view. About building a business that works not because of you but without you.

> What exactly is the Entrepreneurial Model? It’s a model of a business that fulfills the perceived needs of a specific segment of customers in an innovative way.

> Precision instruments are designed to achieve an idea, dimensional precision, where perfection is impossible. There is no perfectly shaped part of the motorcycle and never will be, but when you come as close as these instruments take you, remarkable things happen, and you go flying across the countryside under a power that would be called magic if it were not so completely rational in every way.

> The point is: your business is not your life. Your business and your life are two totally separate things. At its best, your business is something apart from you, rather than a part of you, with its own rules and its own purposes. An organism, you might say, that will live or die according to how well it performs its sole function: to find and keep customers.

> Once you recognize that the purpose of your life is not to serve your business, but that the primary purpose of your business is to serve your life, you can then go to work on your business, rather than in it, with a full understanding of why it is absolutely necessary for you to do so.

> The model will provide consistent value to your customers, employees, suppliers, and lenders, beyond what they expect.

> The model will stand out as a place of impeccable order.

> The model will provide a uniformly predictable service to the customer.

> In this context, the system becomes the tools your people use to increase their productivity, to get the job done in the way it needs to get done in order for your business to successfully differentiate itself from your competition.

Systems like [[Getting Things Done]] (GTD) is a good example of how a system become a tool for accomplishing tasks. There is a certain confidence that is accumulated from getting things done using a systematic method. Checklists and process provide predictability for the task-doer as well as consistency with the outcome.

> The typical owner of a small business prefers highly skilled people because he believes they make his job easier—he can simply leave the work to them. That is, the typical small business owner prefers Management by Abdication to Management by Delegation.

> Individuals need life structure. A life lacking in comprehensive structure is an aimless wreck. The absence of structure breeds breakdown. Structure provides the relatively fixed points of reference we need.

> Documentation says, “This is how we do it here.” Without documentation, all routinized work turns into exceptions.

> Documentation provides your people with the structure they need and with a written account of how to “get the job done” in the most efficient and effective way.

> The Operations Manual—the repository of the documentation—is therefore best described as a company’s How-to-Do-It Guide. It designates the purpose of the work, specifies the steps needed to be taken while doing that work, and summarizes the standards associated with both the process and the result.

> Go to work on your business rather than in it. Go to work on your business as if it were the pre-production prototype of a mass-produceable product.

> “Creativity thinks up new things. Innovation does new things.”

> In short, the definition of a franchise is simply your unique way of doing business.

> And that, I believe, is the heart of the process: not efficiency, not effectiveness, not more money, not to ‘downsize’ or ‘get lean,’ but to simply and finally create more life for everyone who comes into contact with the business, but most of all, for you, the person who owns it.

> Your Business Development Program is the step-by-step process through which you convert your existing business—or the one you’re about to create—into a perfectly organized model for thousands more just like it.

> As with Mature companies, I believe great people to be those who know how they got where they are, and what they need to do to get where they’re going. Great people have a vision of their lives that they practice emulating each and every day.

> I believe it’s true that the difference between great people and everyone else is that great people create their lives actively, while everyone else is created by their lives, passively waiting to see where life takes them next.

> Your **Strategic Objective** is a very clear statement of what your business has to ultimately do for you to achieve your Primary Aim. It is the vision of the finished product that is and will be your business.

> An Opportunity Worth Pursuing is a business that can fulfill the financial standards you’ve created for your **Primary Aim** and your **Strategic Objective**.

Reminds me of [[Ikigai]]—"a reason for being".
