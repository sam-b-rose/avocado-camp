Curiosity is a double-edged sword. It can both drive creativity and hinder productivity by making it challenging to focus on one idea.

- High curiosity allow you to generate lots of creative ideas; it makes it easy to ideate.
- High curiosity also makes it difficult to focus on one idea; it makes it hard to execute.

## Curing curiosity conflict

1. **Keep  [[notes/curiosity-inbox|curiosity-inbox]].** Write down new ideas into a dedicate note. Each time the idea pops up, mark it. This develops a ranked list of ideas based on your long-term interests
2. **Shield time to shift.** Choose an idea from the inbox and spend an hour drafting an execution plan. Break down the idea into smaller, actionable steps. Consider resources requiredâ€“time, money, support.
3. **Practice metacognition.** Reflect regularly on progress to balance exploration and execution. Conduct the [[notes/plus-minus-next]] weekly review.
4. **Embrace the joy of missing out.** There will always be new ideas to explore. Trust that you're not missing out by focusing on your current project.
