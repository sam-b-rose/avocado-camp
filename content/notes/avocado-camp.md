## What is it?

It is my [[notes/digital-garden|digital-garden]] or more like camp of avocados 🏕️🥑. It is my own take on the "garden" metaphor. Avocados are the seeds. The camp is the garden.

I am thankful for every [avocado received](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njYbQI9C6Ac) in life.

## Why the name?

Because I enjoy [[notes/go-to-foods|avocados]], camping, and it was an available [[notes/domains|domain name]].
