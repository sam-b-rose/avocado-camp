Steven Pressfield's main point is to combat and **Resistance** in pursuit of doing the creative work that fulfills you.

## Identifying Resistance

Resistance is the personified character of all the things that keep you from doing your craft. It cannot be seen, touched, heard, or smelled. But it can be felt. It's an energy field radiating from a work-in-potential. Resistance is a self-generated enemy from within.

An act that rejects immediate gratification in favor of long-term growth, health, or integrity. An act that derives from our higher nature instead of our lower. Any of these elicit Resistance.

Anything that draw attention to ourselves through pain-free or artificial means is a manifestation of Resistance.

deathbed.

> Casting yourself as a victim is the antithesis of your work.

Pressfield really drives the point that you are the author of your life. Have agency and be strong and smart enough to overcome Resistance. This requires a mastery and knowing of oneself. We can only combat Resistance is we are able to identify it within ourselves.

> The paradox seems to be, as Socrates demonstrated long ago, that the truly free individual is free only to the extent of his own self-mastery. While those who will not govern themselves are condemned to find masters to govern over them.

## Forms of Resistance

Procrastination is the most common manifestation of Resistance. It's easy to rationalize. We tell ourselves "I'll get that think done. I'll just start tomorrow." Procrastination can become a habit, allowing us to put off our lives not for today, but until our

Fear is another common form of Resistance. The more we feel about something, the more certain we can be that it is important to us. The degree of fear correlates to the strength of the Resistance.

Instead of seeing the fear, Resistance shows us a series of retional justifications for why we shouldn't do our work. It's sneaky.

## Overcoming Resistance

Turn **pro**. The professional dedicates his life to it. Commit full-time to your craft. In essence, focus on the work and its demands to the exclusion of all else.

Pressfield is not suggesting to do nothing but your craft. Rather, fully dedicate yourself to it when you are at work. Hone your focus, be fully present, and execute consistently.

The pro is armed with patience. Patience to give time for the stars to align (opportunities to arise) but more importantly to keep pushing in each individual work.

From the Bhagavad-Gita, we have a right only to our labor, not to the fruits (or [[tags/avocado|avocados]]) of our labor. All the warrior can five is his life, all the athlete can do is leave everything on the field.
