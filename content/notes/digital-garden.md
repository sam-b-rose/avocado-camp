The term "digital garden" is a metaphor for thinking about writing and creatingâ€”a place for thoughts to be planted and grown. Unlike a blog that has it's polished posts, a digital garden focuses on the process and care required to get there.

## Why have a digital garden?

At the root, it comes back to having a practice of writing. For me, writing is a reflection on thoughts. A time to refine and parse through ideas, questions, and curiosities.

A digital garden provides a place for moving those thoughts from the mind to the keyboard and onto the "page". On the page, ideas can be picked up, observed, connected, grown, pruned, and harvested.

Thoughts are fleeting and learned things easily forgotten. Capturing notes is our response tot the fear of letting an idea get away. However, it takes more than just jotting it down to really bring and idea to blossom.

Similar to non-digital gardeners, the the work is difficult but personally therapeutic and rewarding. I am working on this little garden of knowledge for myself to actively engage content rather than  passively consume. In the spirit of learning in the open, I hope you find a few fruits of information helpful and perhaps stirs some curiosity.
