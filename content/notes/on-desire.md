I first heard this quote from Naval [who said](https://twitter.com/naval/status/846774878195757057?lang=en) "desire is a contract with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want". In order to combat desire, I dove into this book to better familiarize myself with the enemy.

## Why do we desire?

What is its biological function? How have others managed desire in order to live a more satisfied life?

William B. Irvine dives into how desire has played a role in human evolution and a broad array of strategies and historical accounts on living more harmoniously with desire.

## Desire in a nutshell

Irvine advocates that it is possible to gain both satisfaction and worldly success. But when this happens, it isn' the success that brings the satisfaction. This is inline with the Stoic idea of "indifference to success". And from the Buddha, it is not power, wealth, and health that cause suffering but the *clinging* to power, wealth, and health.

Our desires don't exist in isolation. The are created because of something else we want (i.e., they are instrumental desires used to satisfy a terminal desire). This means one desire has the potential to create thousands of desires. Be careful about what "initial" desire you form.

We have multiple sources of desire which can even conflict. Desires from emotions can conflict with desires of the intellect. It is impossible for us to satisfy all our desires.

Intellect (the rider) is second rank to our emotions (the elephant) when it comes to desire formation. Our intellect is very skilled at using reason to justify our desires rather than transcending them. However, this isn't all a flaw—intellect helps us more effectively satisfy desires.

We have a biological incentive system (BIS) that what desires we form. We are rewarded for seeking social interaction and approval, eating delicious food, and having sex. Our world would be radically different if our BIS rewarded us for entirely different or opposite things.

The BIS is a result of evolution. It wasn't geared toward encouraging us to live a *happy, meaningful life*. It functions so we are able to survive and reproduce.

We are insatiable. Getting objects of our desire reduces its desirability to us. We experience psychological adaptation (the hedonic treadmill).

## Conclusion

The best way to gain lasting satisfaction is to change ourselves, not the world or our position in it. We should work at wanting we already have.

>Don’t set your mind on things you don’t possess as if they were yours, but count the blessings you actually possess and think how much you would desire them if they weren’t already yours.
>— Marcus Aurelius

**The complete mastery of desire is impossible.** The goal instead should be to attain mastery over our desires. Rather than forming desires with our evolutionary programming, we should take control over the desire formation process.
