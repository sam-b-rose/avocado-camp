The Considered Life. What is the experience of an unconsidered existence? *A thin plastic bag flitting and sailing on the currents of life*.

The roots of self-enquiry. Socrates was the first to offer the advice ‘know thyself’, and said that the **considered life** was the only one worth living.

The four stages which any change through philosophical consideration is based:

1. Humans can know themselves.
2. Humans can change themselves.
3. Humans can create new habits of thinking, feeling, and acting.
4. If we follow philosophy as a way of life, we can live more flourishing lives.

Why study philosophy? Why life a more “flourishing life”?

As Milan Kundera puts it, “there is no dress rehearsal for life. This is life; this is it, right now”.

Each moment you live passes and is gone, never to return. Life is all too brief not to consider how to experience it at its best. **It can happen in the ordinary moments of your everyday life**.
