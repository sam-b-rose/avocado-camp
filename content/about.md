Hi! I'm **Sam Rose**, a Senior Front End Developer working with the talented folks at [Shopify](https://shopify.com/) where we are making commerce better for _everyone_.

Before Shopfiy, I had the pleasure of working with the wonderful people at [Indeed](https://indeed.com/), [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), and [Cadre5](https://www.cadre5.com/).

I am currently traveling around the US most likely where there are mountains to climb and nature to explore.
