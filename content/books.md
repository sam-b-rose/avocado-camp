## To Read

An **antilibrary** is a collection of books that are owned but have not yet been read. The term was coined by [Nassim Nicholas Taleb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb "Nassim Nicholas Taleb"). The concept it describes has been compared to the Japanese *[tsundoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundoku "Tsundoku")*.

> Tsundoku (積ん読) is a beautiful Japanese word describing the habit of acquiring books but letting them pile up without reading them.
