The process of actively asking and answering questions while reading.

Active reading is crucial to increasing the understanding and learning of new material.

## Most important rule of skillful reading

Ask yourself questions and try to answer them as you read. If you just dwell on the question of "what kinds of questions should I be asking", that will also help improve your skill of active reading.

## Turn insights into action

Make the insight actionable. Ask yourself these questions:

- Given this finding or idea, how can I use that?
- What is the action that I can take or that everybody should take?

Derek Sivers is very good at this.
