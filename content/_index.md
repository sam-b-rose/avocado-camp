Hi! I'm Sam. You've discovered my [[notes/digital-garden|digital garden]]. It is a bit different than other sites and blogs, so some context will be useful.

These notes are a collection of my thoughts and thinking written mostly for myself. I am sharing them openly as an experiment of learning in the open.

You can use the search or navigate around by following the links. You might be interested in some of these as a starting point:
